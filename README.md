# Tic-Tac-Toe 1.0

A Web 1.0 Tic-Tac-Toe game for the Odin Project. Pretty simple app using largely using Factory and Module design patterns for JS.

**Required languages**: JS

# What I Learned

* Factory and Module design patterns.
* Design patterns, period. 
* CSS art direction, rather than desperate placement. 
* Dynamic DOM elements. 
* Scope management. 

Huge thanks to Esteban Moroy, whose exceptionally informative and clean JS code was borrowed largely for this project. Here's a link to [his work](https://github.com/estebanmoroy), along with his [Tic Tac Toe submission](https://github.com/estebanmoroy/tic-tac-toe) for the Odin Project.
